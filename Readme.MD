While working with a public API, I encountered a challenge when I discovered that the API URL was blocked on certain networks. To overcome this restriction, I developed a simple proxy solution that allows you to access the API response.

Here's how it works:

By adding https://YOUR_PROXY_URL/proxy?url=YOUR_API_URL before your actual API URL, you can bypass the restrictions and receive the desired response from the API.
